            <p>
                My career goal is actually to be a computer scientist! I say that in the sense that I want to develop
                and maintain the use of large language models (llms) and machine learning algortithms (ML). I really
                started taking an interest in computer science because it is what my dad does for his line of work, But
                I truly started to take notice of "AI" a few years ago and I have been fascinated on how to incorporate it
                into medical technology to help identify ailements quicker and more effectively.

            <h2 id = "descriptors" >What I know about web design so far:</h2>
            <p>
                I believe I know a decent bit about web design so far. While building the website I am trying not to look at 
                any references; and I would say that I am doing a good job so far. I am confident in the html aspect if my learning
                but the css portion confuses me still. There are so many aspects that I haven't learned and the others I simply need 
                to practice more. In a little bit, hopefully by the end of this course, I will be a master at css.
